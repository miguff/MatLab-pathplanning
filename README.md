# Matlab Pathplanning
So in this project I am going to use Matlab to write a VHF/VFH+ algorithm combined with RL (Reinforcement Learning). First going to do it in a 2D environment.
Than when it can solve problems/labirinths there, i am going to proceed to the 3D space.
This is a small step of a greates project which is going to be a air quality measuring drone.
